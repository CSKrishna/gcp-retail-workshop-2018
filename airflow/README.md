# Airflow Hands-On Lab
## Overview
This lab is designed to demonstrate how to use Terraform to create a compute instance and then configure an Airflow instance using Ansible.

Precocity uses Terraform for overall infrastrucutre deployment and Ansible for the installation and configuration management of resources.

## Hands-On
